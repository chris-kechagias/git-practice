# Git & GitHub Practice

Learning version control fundamentals as part of my transition from Retail Management to AI Engineering.

## What I Practiced

✅ Repository creation and management  
✅ Making meaningful commits  
✅ Working with branches and merging  
✅ SSH authentication on Windows  
✅ Remote repository management  
✅ Collaboration workflows  

## Key Commands Mastered
```bash
# Repository basics
git init
git clone
git status

# Committing changes
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# Branching
git branch feature-name
git checkout feature-name
git merge feature-name

# Remote management
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin <url>
```

## Challenges Overcome

- SSH key setup on Windows (different from Mac/Linux)
- Understanding the difference between local and remote repos
- Learning proper commit message conventions

## What's Next

Building real projects:
- CLI applications with Python
- REST APIs with FastAPI
- Computer vision with PyTorch
- LLM applications with LangChain
